### Sprint 1 Review

Goals completed:

- [x] User Story 5.1 : Creating an ERD
- [x] User Story 5.2 : Creating a Database
- [x] User Story 4.2 : Adding Data
- [x] User Story 1.2 : Opening the application

**Retrospective:**

<u>The good:</u>

- I predicted what I could do for this sprint and achieved all my goals within a good time frame. All goals have been met with the product owner being satisfied

<u>The bad:</u>

- I definitely could have spent a shorter amount of time creating dummy data for my database and allocated more time into other parts of the user story such as the GUI.


<u>What to change:</u>

- Allocate to a certain time frame and give each user story equal time to be done, if finished early start the next user story, if unfinished leave it and start the next user story, work on it if there is spare time.

- [x] User Story 4.5 : Updating Data
- [x] User Story 6.1 : Unit Tests for Business Layer

**Retrospective**

<u>The good</u>

- All goals have been met, basic GUI read functionality added to a ListView for Products table. All CRUD functions have been unit tested and ready to be implemented

<u>The bad</u>

- Creating Unit Tests and debugging them dragged the initial time schedule behind by hours, I did underestimated creating the Unit Tests with full code coverage to take  

<u>What to change</u>

- Change the GUI to include Material Design as it has a better design than the default materials.
