### Sprint 1 Review

Goals completed:

- [x] User Story 5.1 : Creating an ERD
- [x] User Story 5.2 : Creating a Database
- [x] User Story 4.2 : Adding Data
- [x] User Story 1.2 : Opening the application

**Retrospective:**

<u>The good:</u>

- I predicted what I could do for this sprint and achieved all my goals within a good time frame. All goals have been met with the product owner being satisfied

<u>The bad:</u>

- I definitely could have spent a shorter amount of time creating dummy data for my database and allocated more time into other parts of the user story such as the GUI.

<u>What to do/change:</u>

- Allocate to a certain time frame and give each user story equal time to be done, if finished early start the next user story, if unfinished leave it and start the next user story, work on it if there is spare time.

### Sprint 2

- [ ] User Story 4.3 : Reading Data
- [ ] User Story 4.4 : Deleting Data
- [ ] User Story 4.5 : Updating Data

### Sprint 2 Review

Goals Completed:

- [x] User Story 4.3 : Reading Data
- [x] User Story 4.4 : Deleting Data
- [x] User Story 4.5 : Updating Data
- [x] User Story 6.1 : Unit Tests for Business Layer
- [x] User Story 6.2 : Unit Tests for Data Layer

**Retrospective**

<u>The good</u>

- All goals have been met, basic GUI read functionality added to a ListView for Products table. All CRUD functions have been unit tested and ready to be implemented

<u>The bad:</u>

- Creating Unit Tests and debugging them dragged the initial time schedule behind by hours, I did underestimated creating the Unit Tests with full code coverage to take  

<u>What to do/change</u>:

- Change the GUI to include Material Design as it has a better design than the default materials.

### Sprint 3 Review

Goals Completed:

- [x] User Story 4.1 : Developer/Admin side screen
- [x] User Story 1.3 : Navigation
- [ ] User Story 2.2 : Adding to cart
- [ ] User Story 2.3 : Removing from the shopping cart

**Retrospective**

<u>The good:</u>

- Admin side pages is fully implemented, barring order page. Fully functional pages with exception handling and quality of life backend logic.

<u>The bad:</u>

- Not all sprint goals were met, however it was intentional since to implement features to meet this user stories' acceptance criteria may require changes to the database, thus it may take a long time to redesign for this user story and will be left for future sprints

<u>What to do/change:</u>

- User Story 2.2 and 2.3 will be moved back to project backlog, and if it were to be moved back into sprint backlog include User Story 2.1 and 3.3.
- Recheck overall goals for current sprint to ensure that they can be met

### Sprint 4 

Goals for this sprint:

- [ ] User Story 2.1 : Shopping Cart
- [ ] User Story 2.2 : Adding to cart
- [ ] User Story 2.3 : Removing from the shopping cart
- [ ] User Story 3.3 : Order History

### Sprint 5 Review

Goals Completed:

- [x] User Story 1.1 : Search bar
- [x] Enhancement: Material Design / Stretch Goal - Make it look modern

**Retrospective**

<u>The good</u>

- There is now a background image on all pages of the window, with material design added for all pages including admin side. 

<u>The bad</u>

- There is still no separation from admin to user in the main application

<u>What to do/change</u>

- Add another table to comply with User Story 3.1 and 3.2

### Sprint 6 Review

Goals Completed:

- [ ] User Story 3.1 : Log In
- [ ] User Story 3.2 : Register Screen

**Retrospective**

<u>The good</u>:

- This product has been given the final OK from the product owner, despite missing 2 user stories. It has all the main functionalities and can definitely be reformed/refactored to include the last 2 user stories.

<u>The bad:</u>

- Due to time constraints there was not enough time to fully complete the last two user stories, instead of leaving it half finished I decided to revert it back to the previous working state.

<u>What to do/change:</u>

- For the future, if I were to implement a registration and log in page I will prioritise it first above all else.

### Project Retrospective

<u>What went well?</u>

- I have achieved a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for my project and I am overall satisfied with how it works, both with the backend and frontend of things.
- Utilising GitHub to ensure that I have something to fall back to in case of a fatal human error or finding an unfixable bug/issue
- Working on this project solo meant that I had to work as both the developer, tester and product owner, giving me experience on how to think on a product through all three point of views.

<u>What could be improved?</u>

- Time management - there have been sprints in which I was unable to complete all objectives, however this is due to underestimation of the difficulty of the task which was not checked before hand.

<u>Actions for the future</u>

- Utilise Agile methods more, being able to have an increment to show makes it easy to see the progress of your project at the end of each sprint and gives you more direction on which user story can be implemented next
- Stick to time constraints - despite sprints already having a time constraint, by limiting each user story to a time constraint then you can temporarily hold off on user stories that aren't finished, categorise them as blockers and work on them at a later sprint.
